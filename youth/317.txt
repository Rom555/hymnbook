Am[G]azing grace! How sw[C]eet the s[G]ound
That saved a wretch like m[D7]e!
I [G]once was lost but n[C]ow I’m f[G]ound;
Was bl[Em]ind, but n[G]ow [D7]I se[G]e.

’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears reliev’d;
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believ’d!

Thro’ many dangers, toils and snares, 
I have already come; 
’Tis grace has brought me safe thus far, 
And grace will lead me home.

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow, 
The sun forbear to shine; 
But God, who call’d me here below, 
Will be forever mine.
