I [C]have decided to follow Jesus
[C7]I have dec[F]ided to follow J[C]esus
[C]I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning b[Am]ack[G], no turning b[C]ack

Though none go with me, still I will follow (x3)
No turning back, no turning back

My cross Iâ€™ll cary till I see Jesus (x3)
No turning back, no turning back 

The world behind me the cross before me, (x3)
No turning back, no turning back.
