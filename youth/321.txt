P[G]ass me n[C]ot o gentle S[G]avi[Em]our,
H[Am]ear my h[D7]umble cr[G]y!
While on [C]others Thou art c[G]all[Em]ing.
D[Am]o not p[D7]ass me b[G]y 

P:
S[G]aviour, S[C]aviour,
H[G]ear my humble cr[D7]y!
Wh[G]ile on [C]others Thou art c[G]all[Em]ing,
Do[Am] not p[D7]ass me b[G]y.

Let me at Thy throne of mercy, 
find a sweet relief:
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
help my unbelief.

Trusting only in Thy merit, 
would I seek Thy face;
Heal my broken wounded spirit; 
save me by Thy grace

Thou the spring of all my comfort, 
more than life to me.
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heaven but Thee?
