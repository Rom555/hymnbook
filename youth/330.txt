S[Em]et me free from chains that grip my sp[H]irit
M[Am]aking me a slave of wr[H7]etched s[Em]in!
Stumbling in my life I cannot br[H7]eak through,
C[Am]aptive of my own mist[D]akes and habits
[G]I am trapped in prison, s[E7]o I ask: set me fr[Am]ee
O S[H7]avior, set me fr[Em]ee.

Lift me up above all things that hold me
Down to earthly sorrow, sin, and shame.
Pulling me yet deeper into darkness,
All my strength is gone; it’s only weakness,
Falling to my knees, I cry to You: lift me up,
O Savior, lift me up!

Draw me near into Your loving presence,
Lord forgive me for the things I’ve done!
Cleanse me with Your blood and make me holy,
Come into my heart, revive my spirit,
I was far away but now I plead: draw me near,
My Savior, draw me near!
	
Bring me home where we shall dwell together
And forever share this blessed life.
You will wipe away all tears from my eyes,
||: I am overfilled with joy for heaven!
Now my heart desires so I say: bring me home,
My Savior, bring me home! :||
