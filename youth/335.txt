God sent His s[G]on, they called Him, J[C]esus;[Am]
He came to l[G]ove, heal and forg[Am]ive;[D7]
He lived and d[G]ied to buy my p[C]ardon,
An [Cm6]empty gr[G]ave is there to pr[D7]ove my Savior l[D7]ives! 

P:
Because He lives, I can face tom[C]orrow,
Because He l[G]ives, all fear is g[D7]one;
Because I know He holds the f[C]uture,
And l[Cm6]ife is w[G]orth the living, j[D7]ust because He l[G]ives!

How sweet to hold a newborn baby,
And feel the pride and joy he gives;
But greater still the calm assurance:
This child can face uncertain days because He Lives! 

And then one day, I'll cross the river,
I'll fight life's final war with pain;
And then, as death gives way to vict'ry,
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives!
