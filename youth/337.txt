[G]Above all p[C]owers[D], above all k[G]ings
Above all n[C]ature and [D]all created th[G]ings
Above all w[Em]isdom and [D]all the ways of m[C]an
Y[Am]ou were here bef[C]ore the world b[D]egan

P:
Cr[G]ucif[Am]ied and l[D]aid behind a st[G]one
You lived to d[Am]ie rej[D]ected and al[G]one
Like a r[Em]ose tr[D]ampled on the gr[C]ound [G/H]
You took the f[Am7]all  and t[G/H]hought of [C]me[D]   above [G]all


Above all kingdoms  above all thrones
Above all wonders the world has ever known
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth
There's no way to measure what you're worth

Above all powers  above all kings
Above all nature and all created things
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man
You were here before the world began
