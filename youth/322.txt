Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,

The death of my Savior could only atone. :||

Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,
The holy commandment forbade me draw near;
||: The blood of the cross is my only foundation,
The death of my Savior removeth my fear. :||

Nor silver nor gold hath obtained 1my redemption,
The way into Heaven could not thus be bought;
||: The blood of the cross is my only foundation,
The death of my Savior redemption hath wrought. :||
