L[Dm]et the beauty of Jesus be s[F]een in m[A]e,
[Dm]All His wonderful passion and p[F]urity;
||: [B]O Thou Spirit div[F]ine, [Gm]all my nature ref[Dm]ine
Till the beauty of Jesus be s[A]een in m[Dm]e. :||

Let my wonderful Saviour be seen in me,
His amazing compassion and constancy;
||: His great love is my goal, By His Spirit's control
Till my wonderful Saviour be seen in me. :||

Let the fruit of the Spirit be seen in me,
Grant me grace all sufficient that I may be
||: True and faithful each day, every step of the way.
Pointing souls to the Saviour on Calvary. :||
