Day by d[D]ay and with each passing mom[Em]ent,
Strength I f[A7]ind to meet my trials h[D]ere;
Trusting in my Father's wise bestowm[Em]ent,
I've no c[A7]ause for worry and for f[D]ear.
He whose heart is kind beyond all meas[G]ure
Gives unt[A7]o each day what He deems b[D]est--
Lovingly, its part of pain and pleas[Em]ure,
Mingling t[A7]oil with peace and r[D]est.

Ev'ry day the Lord Himself is near me
With a special mercy for each hour;
All my cares He fain would bear, and cheer me,
He whose name is Counselor and Pow'r.
The protection of His child and treasure
Is a charge that on Himself He laid;
"As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,"
This the pledge to me He made.

Help me then in eve'ry tribulation
So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,
That I lose not faith's sweet consolation
Offered me within Thy holy Word.
Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,
E'er to take, as from a father's hand,
One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,
Till I reach the promised land.
