Have you b[G]een to Jesus for the cleansing power?
Are you washed in the blood of the L[D7]amb?
Are you f[G]ully trusting in His gr[C]ace this hour?
Are you w[G]ashed in the bl[D7]ood of the L[G]amb?

P:
Are you washed in the bl[C]ood,
In the s[G]oul-cleansing blood of the L[D7]amb?
Are your g[G]arments spotless are they wh[C]ite as snow?
Are you w[G]ashed in the bl[D7]ood of the L[G]amb?

Are you walking daily by the savior's side?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Do you rest each moment in the Crucified?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

When the Bridegroom cometh, will your robes be white?
Pure and white in the blood of the Lamb?
Will your souls be ready for the mansions bright
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb?

Lay aside your garments that are stained with sin
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb.
There's a fountain flowing for the soul unclean.
O, be washed in the blood of the Lamb!
