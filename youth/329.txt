The L[E]ord's our Rock, [H]in H[E]im we hide,
A shelter in the time of st[H7]orm;
Sec[E]ure whatev[H]er [E]ill betide,
A shelter in the t[H7]ime of st[E]orm.

P:
Oh, J[A]esus is a Rock in a w[E]eary land,
A w[H7]eary land, a we[E]ary l[E7]and;
Oh, J[A]esus is a Rock in a w[E]eary land,
A sh[Cm#]elter in the t[H7]ime of st[E]orm.

A shade by day, defense by night,
A shelter in the time of storm;
No fears alarm, no foes affright,
A shelter in the time of storm.

The raging storms may round us beat,
A shelter in the time of storm
We'll never leave our safe retreat,
A shelter in the time of storm.

O Rock divine, O Refuge dear,
A shelter in the time of storm;
Be Thou our helper ever near,
A shelter in the time of storm.
