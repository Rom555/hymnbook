[C]And all these th[Em]ings shall be [Am]added unto y[Em]ou
[Dm7]Allel[C]u, alle[G]lui[C]a

Man does not live by bread alone
But by every word
That proceeds from the mouth of God
Allelu, alleluia

Ask and it shall be given unto you
Seek and ye shall find
Knock and the door shall be opened unto you
Allelu, alleluia
