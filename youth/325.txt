Wh[D]at a friend we have in J[G]esus, [D]All ours sins and griefs to b[A]ear,
Wh[D]at a privilege to c[G]arry [D]Everyth[A]ing to God in pr[D]ayer!
[A]O what peace we often f[D]orfeit, [G]O what n[D]eedless pain we b[A]ear, 
[D]All because we do not c[G]arry [D]Everyth[A]ing to God in pr[D]ayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.


Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour still our refuge;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer!
In His arms Heâ€¢ll take and shield thee;
Thou wilt find a solace there.
