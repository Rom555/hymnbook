B[A]e not dismayed whate’er betide,
G[E7]od will take care of y[A]ou;
Beneath His wings of love abide,
G[E7]od will take care of y[A]ou.[A7]

P:
G[D]od will take c[A]are of you,
Thr[E7]ough every day, o’er all the w[A]ay;
He will take c[D]are of y[C#]ou,
G[D]od will take c[A]are [E7]of y[A]ou.

Through days of toil when heart doth fail,
God will take care of you;
When dangers fierce your path assail,
God will take care of you.

All you may need He will provide,
God will take care of you;
Nothing you ask will be denied,
God will take care of you.

No matter what may be the test,
God will take care of you;
Lean, weary one, upon His breast,
God will take care of you.
