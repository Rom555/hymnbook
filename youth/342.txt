[D]Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go;
[A7]Anywhere He leads me in this world bel[D]ow.
Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade;
Anywhere with J[G]esus I am n[D]ot [A7]afr[D]aid.

P:
[A7]Anywhere, [D]anywhere!
F[Bm]ear I c[E7]annot kn[A7]ow;
[D]Anywhere with J[G]esus
I can s[D]afel[A7]y g[G]o.

Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;
Other friends may fail me, He is still my own.
Though His hand may lead me over dreary ways,
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.

Anywhere with Jesus, over land and sea,
Telling souls in darkness of salvation free.
Ready as He summons me to go or stay;
Anywhere with Jesus when He points the way.

Anywhere with Jesus, I can go to sleep 
When the dark'ning shadows 'round about me creep.
Knowing I shall waken never more to roam;
Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.
