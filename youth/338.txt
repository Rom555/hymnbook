Y[G]ou are my str[D]ength when I am w[Em]eak
You are the tr[G]easure that I s[C]eek
You are my [G]all [D]in [G]all [D]
S[G]eeking You [D]as a precious j[Em]ewel
Lord to give [G]up, I'd be a f[C]ool
You are my [G]all [D]in [G]all [D]

P:
J[G]es[D]us, L[Em]amb of God, w[C]orthy [D7]is Your n[G]ame
J[G]es[D]us, L[Em]amb of God, w[C]orthy [D7]is Your n[G]ame


Taking my sin, my cross, my shame
Rising again, I bless Your name
You are my all in all
When I fall down, You pick me up
When I am dry, You fill my cup
You are my all in all
