St[G]anding on the promises of Christ my King,
Thr[C]ough eternal ages let His pr[G]aises ring;
Glory in the highest I will shout and sing,
St[D7]anding on the promises of G[G]od.

P:
St[G]anding, st[C]anding, 
St[D7]anding on the promises of Chr[G]ist my Saviour;
Standing, st[C]anding
I'm st[G]anding on the pr[D7]omises of G[G]od.

Standing on the promises that cannot fail,
When the howling storms of doubt and fears assail;
By the living Word of God I shall prevail,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises that cannot fail,
List'ning every moment to the Spirit's call;
Resting in my Saviour as my All-in-All,
Standing on the promises of God.
