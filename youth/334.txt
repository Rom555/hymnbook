[D]All to Jesus [A]I surrender,
[Hm]All to H[G]im I fr[A]eely g[D]ive;
I will ever l[A]ove and tr[F#]ust Him,
[Hm]In His pr[Em]esence d[A]aily l[D]ive.

P:
I surrender [Em]all, [A]I surrender [D]all.  
All to Thee, my blessed S[G]avior, [A]I surrender [D]all.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Humbly at His feet I bow,
Worldly pleasures all forsaken;
Take me, Jesus, take me now.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Make me, Savior, wholly Thine;
Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit,
Truly know that Thou art mine.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Lord, I give myself to Thee;
Fill me with Thy love and power,
Let Thy blessing fall on me.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Now I feel the sacred flame.
Oh, the joy of full salvation!
Glory, glory to His name!
