Th[A]ere shall be sh[E7]owers of bl[A]essing,  
Th[E7]is is the promise of l[A]ove,
Th[D]ere shall be seasons r[A]efreshing, 
S[F#m]ent from the Savior ab[E7]ove,

P:
Sh[A]owers of blessing, 
Showers of Blessing we n[E7]eed,
M[A]ercy drops r[D]ound us are f[A]alling, 
B[E7]ut for the showers we pl[A]ead.
 
There shall be showers of blessing, 
Precious reviving again,
Over the hills and the valleys, 
Sound of abundance of rain.

There shall be showers of blessing, 
Send them upon us, O Lord,
Grant to us now a refreshing, Come, 
and now honor thy Word.

There shall be show-ers of blessing, 
Oh, that today they might fall,
Now as to God we're confessing, 
Now as on Jesus we call!
