Wh[E]at can wash a[C#m7]way my sin? 
N[E]othing but the b[C#m7]lood of [H7]Jes[E]us
Wh[E]at can make me w[C#m7]hole again? 
N[E]othing but the b[C#m7]lood of [H7]Jes[E]us

P:
[E]Oh! Precious is the flow
Th[H7]at makes me white as sn[E]ow;
N[E]o other fount I know,
[C#m7]Nothing but the bl[A2]ood of [H7]Jes[E]us

For my pardon this I see, 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
For my cleansing this my plea, 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Nothing can for sin atone,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
Naught of good that I have done,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

This is all my hope and peace, 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
This is all my righteousness, 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
