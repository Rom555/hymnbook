J[F]esus is [B]all the [F/C]world t[C7]o m[F]e, my life, my j[C7]oy, my [F]all; 
He [C]is my strength from d[F]ay to day, with[G]out Him I would f[C7]all. 
Wh[F]en I am sad to Him I go; no other one can cheer me so; 
Wh[Dm]en I am s[B]ad, H[F]e makes me gl[C]ad; H[F]e's m[C]y fri[F]end. 

Jesus is all the world to me, my friend in trials sore; 
I go to Him for blessings, and He gives them o'er and o'er. 
He sends the sunshine and the rain, 
He sends the harvest's golden grain' 
Sunshine and rain, harvest of grain; He's my friend.

Jesus is all the world to me, and true to Him I'll be; 
Oh, how could I this friend deny when He's so true to me? 
Following Him, I know I'm right, He watches o'er me day and night' 
Following Him, by day and night; He's my friend. 

Jesus is all the world to me, I want no better friend; 
I trust Him now, I'll trust Him when life's fleeting days shall end. 
Beautiful life with such a friend, beautiful life that has no end; 
Eternal life, eternal joy; He's my friend.
