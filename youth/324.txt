[Em]I will dwell in the sh[C]adow of your wings, 
[D]I will know of the p[H7]eace your love can bring.
N[Em]ight will fall but I w[Am7]ill not be afraid 
When I dw[H7]ell in the shadow of your w[Em]ings.

P:
[E7]In the sh[Am]adow, in the sh[Em]adow, 
[H7]In the shadow of your w[Em]ings.
[E7]In the sh[Am]adow, in the sh[Em]adow, 
[H7]In the shadow of your w[Em]ings.

Safety lies in the shadow of your wings, 
I rely on your faithful covering;
Arrows fly but I will not be afraid
When I dwell in the shadow of your wings.
