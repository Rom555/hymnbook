Teach me, L[Dm]ord, how to pr[Gm]ay in contr[B]iti[A7]on,
And Your h[Gm]oly comm[A7]ands to fulf[Dm]ill;
Free my h[C]eart from its pride and amb[C7]iti[F]on,
May it [A]always conf[Gm]orm t[A]o Your w[Dm]ill.
May it [Gm]always conf[A7]orm to Your w[Dm]ill.

May You reign in my heart without measure,
And Your Spirit my spirit control;
May in You I find all of my pleasure
||: And Your name in my heart thus extol. :||

Cleanced within by the blood of my Savior
May my heart be kept free from all sin;
May it find its delight and its favor,
||: As it loves both my foes and my kin. :||
