[C]As the [Em/H]deer panteth f[Am]or the water
So my s[F]oul longs [G]after Th[C]ee [G7]
Y[C]ou [Em/H]alone are my h[Am]eart's desire
And I l[F]ong to w[G]orship Th[C]ee

P:
Y[Am]ou alone are my st[F]ength, my sh[C]ield 
To Y[F]ou alone may my sp[Dm]irit y[E7]ield 
Y[C]ou [Em/H]alone are my h[Am]eart's desire 
And I l[F]ong to w[G]orship Th[C]ee 

You're my friend and You are my Father
Even though You are a King
I love You more than any other
So much more than anything   

I want You more than gold or silver 
Only You can satisfy 
You alone are the real joy giver
And the apple of my eye
